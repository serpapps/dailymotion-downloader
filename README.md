## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I download private videos?
A: If you can watch the video in your browser (including logged-in or passworded videos you have access to), you can download it. If you cannot view it, you cannot download it.

### Q: How many videos can I download?
A: After purchasing the extension you have lifetime access to it and future upgrades—you can download as many videos as you want.

### Q: Do you track what I download?
A: No. Everything happens locally on your computer and is never sent to our servers.

### Q: Where is the video saved?
A: Videos save to whatever folder your browser uses for downloads (usually your Downloads folder unless you changed it).

### Q: How long does it take to download?
A: It depends on the video length, resolution, and your connection speed. Short clips finish quickly; long or high-resolution videos take longer.

### Q: Is my data private?
A: All detection and conversion happen locally. Only licence checks touch remote servers, and no viewing history or passwords are stored.

### Q: Is this legal?
A: **DISCLAIMER:** We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform. For any legal question please consult a qualified legal professional.

We give you full control over download speeds because we believe users should decide how they use their software.

That said, here are a few widely accepted best practices for safe, responsible downloading:

1. Only download content you created, own, or have explicit permission from the rights holder to access.
2. Protect your personal data by respecting platform rules and rate limits with reasonable download speeds to avoid automated abuse systems putting your account at risk.
3. Protect your privacy by using a reputable VPN for IP protection before initiating downloads — [this is the VPN we recommend & use](https://serp.ly/best/vpn).

## About

Dailymotion is a major video hosting platform used by creators, broadcasters, and content distributors worldwide. However, like many video platforms, it doesn't provide a way to download videos for offline viewing or archival purposes.

Whether you're a content creator managing your own library, a production team preparing client deliverables, or someone who needs offline access to educational or professional videos, Dailymotion Downloader solves the problem quickly and reliably.

Instead of juggling manual captures or questionable browser extensions, Dailymotion Downloader pulls content directly from Dailymotion with consistent quality and predictable results. Move quickly from download to delivery without tedious rework.
